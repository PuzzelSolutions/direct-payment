## Pay

Use the Pay method to directly charge a mobile subscription with a provided amount. It is also mandatory to specify a [service code](service-codes.md) for a transaction that describes the category and in turn will effect the payout. The mobile subscription is charged immediately and you will get a synchronous response from the API. It is not necessary for the mobile phone to be turned on in order for the transaction to go through.

Note that some of our services requires the mobile phone subscription to be verified before use - see [here](methods.md#send-verification-code) for details.

Also please note that currently the following norwegian mobile network operators are supported through the API: Telenor, Telio (former Netcom) and Network Norway. Once the other norwegian mobile network operators start supporting Direct Payment, they will be automatically available for you through this API.

## Send verification code

Some of our services requires that the mobile phone number to be charged is verified. This is to ensure that end-user do not enter a random mobile phone number to be charged. To verify a mobile phone number, use the "Send verification code" method which will generate a pin code and send it by sms to the specified mobile phone number. Your client must then provide the end user with an interface where the pin code can be entered and verified. Even though it is optional to set the expiration time when using this functionality, keep in mind that people change phone numbers every now and then, so we advise to set the expiration time to 1 year ahead in time.

## PreAuthorize

PreAuthorized payments are recurring payments where the End User have confirmed that the payment transactions (including premium SMS transactions) for a merchant can be executed without End User confirmation on each transaction.

This method returns a token to be used in subsequent Pay requests or Premium SMS requests. The token is issued by Strex and does not expire. However it can be manually invalidated by Strex in some situations if the Code of Conduct is violated.

Please note that the End User needs to be a user on the Strex platform for this to be successful.

NB This method is only available on the REST interface and it allows you to use the serviceId, username and password from either the SMS platform or Direct Pay platform. See the <a href="rest-interface.md">REST interface</a> for details regarding authentication.
